This website documents data processing pipeline developed for the study **Putting in the Effort: Modulation of Multimodal Effort in Communicative Breakdowns during a Gestural-Vocal Referential Game**. The study is a part of the project associated with ViCom project [**On the FLExibility and Stability of Gesture-speecH Coordination (FLESH)**](https://vicom.info/projects/on-the-flexibility-and-stability-of-gesture-speech-coordination-flesh-evidence-from-production-comprehension-and-imitation/). The pipeline covers every step from raw data processing to feature extraction and analysis, focusing on extraction of motion and acoustic signals, cleaning and preparation of relevant analyses.

## Current study

We recruited 60 Dutch dyads (i.e., 120 individuals) ti participate in a gestural-vocal referential game. One person of the dyad acts as a performer, and one as a guesser. The performer’s role is to express meaning in one of the three conditions: using only voice, only gesture, or both. The guesser’s role is to guess the meaning. If the answer is not correct, the performer has two more chances to repair themselves. In total, each dyad performs 42 different concepts in three modality conditions, and partners swap roles within each condition. We recorded performers' movement, vocalizations, and postural sway. 

Our main research question addressess whether (and how) people become more effortful when they attempt to resolve misunderstanding in a novel-communication gestural-vocal task. Effort-related features of interest include upper limb torque, acoustic amplitude envelope, and center of pressure.

## Two-phase preregistration

This study has been preregistered in two phases.

In phase I, we preregistered the experimental design, laboratory setup and power analysis. The preregistration is available at the [OSF Registries](https://osf.io/3nygq).

In phase II, we preregistered the research questions and hypothesis, together with code pipeline covering pre-processing, processing and the analysis itself. The preregistration is available at the [OSF Registries](https://osf.io/8ajsg).

## Pipeline Overview

This study builds on multi-step pipeline that serves to
- extract the raw data
- process them
- extract relevant features
- analyze with regards to research questions

See [Methods section](method.qmd) for conceptual overview of the processing and analysis steps.

Note that in this workflow, each step builds on the previous one. However, it is possible to use parts of the workflow for different purposes.

#### Preprocessing of the raw data
- In [Pre-Processing I: from XDF to raw files](01_XDF_processing/xdf_workflow.ipynb) we load and clean raw XDF data, align streams, and prepare for downstream processing.

#### Motion Tracking Processing
- In [Motion tracking I: Preparation of videos](02_MotionTracking_processing/01_Video_preparation.ipynb) we crop video recordings and prepare them for motion capture.
- In [Motion tracking II: 2D pose estimation via OpenPose](02_MotionTracking_processing/02_Track_OpenPose.ipynb) we use OpenPose for 2D pose estimation.
- In [Motion tracking III: Triangulation via Pose2sim](02_MotionTracking_processing/03_Track_pose2sim.ipynb) we convert 2D coordinates to 3D using pose2sim.
- In [Motion tracking IV: Modeling inverse kinematics and dynamics](02_MotionTracking_processing/04_Track_InverseKinDyn.ipynb) we compute inverse kinematics and dynamics using OpenSim.

#### Signal Processing
- In [Processing I: Motion tracking and balance](03_TS_processing/01_TS_processing_motion.ipynb) we clean and interpolate motion signals, and extract derivatives such as speed, acceleration and jerk.
- In [Processing II: Acoustics](03_TS_processing/02_TS_processing_acoustics.ipynb) we extract relevant acoustic features.
- In [Processing III: Merging multimodal data](03_TS_processing/03_TS_merging.ipynb) we merge motion and acoustic time series.

#### Movement Annotation
- In [Movement annotation I: Preparing training data and data for classifier](04_TS_movementAnnotation/01_Classify_preparation.ipynb) we prepare our multimodal time series for training purposes.
- In [Movement annotation II: Training movement classifier, and annotating timeseries data](04_TS_movementAnnotation/02_MovementClassifier.ipynb) we train and evaluate classifiers for movement detection.
- In [Movement annotation III: Computing interrater agreement between manual and automatic annotation](04_TS_movementAnnotation/03_InterAgreement.ipynb) we evaluate inter-annotator agreement.

#### Final Merge
- In [Final merge](05_finalMerge/TS_mergeAnnotations.ipynb) we merge annotations with timeseries.

#### Concept Similarity
- In [Computing concept similarity using ConceptNet word embeddings](06_ConceptSimilarity/ConceptNet_similarity.ipynb): we assess semantic similarity between concepts using ConceptNet.

#### Feature Extraction
- In [Extraction of effort-related features](07_TS_featureExtraction/TS_extraction.ipynb) we extract features from the multimodal time series for modelling purposes.

#### Exploratory Analysis: Most Predictive Features of Effort
- In [Exploratory Analysis I: Using PCA to identify effort dimensions](08_Analysis_XGBoost/01_PCA_featureDimensions.ipynb) we explore dimensionality of extracted features using Principal Component Analysis.
- In [Exploratory Analysis II: Identifying effort-related features contributing to misunderstanding resolution](08_Analysis_XGBoost/02_XGBoost_effortIndicators.qmd) we assess feature importance using eXtreme Gradient Boosting.

#### Confirmatory Analysis: Statistical Modelling
- In [Statistical Analysis: Modelling the Effect of Communicative Attempt (H1) and Answer Similarity (H2) on Effort](09_Analysis_Modeling/Modelling_syntheticData.qmd) we build causal and statistical models testing our hypothesis.
