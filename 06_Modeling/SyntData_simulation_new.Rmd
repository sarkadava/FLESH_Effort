# Introduction

The experimental design is described in the preregistration here: https://osf.io/m9xep (@Daniela, you can skip the section Lab Equipment)

In this markdown, we will be modelling the causal relation between effort and correction to confirm/reject our hypothesis.

These are:

H1: In corrections, people will enhance some effort-related kinematic and/or acoustic features of their behaviour

H2: The enhancement will depend on similarity of the guesser's answer and the original meaning. More similar answer will require/result in smaller enhancement (but still enhancement) than less similar answer.

# Setting up the environment

```{r warning=FALSE}

library(here)
library(dagitty) # for dag
library(dplyr) # for data-wrangling
library(lme4)  # for linear mixed-effects models
library(tidyr)  # for reshaping data (if needed)

```

# DAG

To make sure we know what variables should be in the model and why, we draw a DAG that illustrates our assumptions

Our relationship of interest is the causal effect of communicative attempt on effort.

Other assumptions include:

Personality traits (measured with Big5) will influence effort (e.g., people are more willing to put more effort if they are open-minded) and also communicative attempt (e.g., more extroverted people are better in this game, therefore they need less attempts)

Familiarity with guessing partner influences effort (ditto) as well as communicative attempt (e.g., friends are better in this game than strangers)

Similarly, participant will also directly infleunce effort and commAtt, because personality traits might not be capturing all variation

Expressibility of concepts is going to influence effort (e.g., more expressible concepts allow more enhancement - but could be also other direction) as well as CommAtt (e.g., more expressible concepts are more readily guessed and don't need more attempts)

Similarly, concept will also directly influence effort and commAtt, because expressibility might not be capturing all variation

Modality (uni vs. multi) will influence the value of effort. We assume that in unimodal condition, the feature does not need to account for synergic relations with the other modality, and may carry the whole signal. In multimodal condition, however, there may be synergic relations that moderate the full expressiveness of this feature

Lastly, trial number (characterising how for one is in the experiment) could be hinting on learning processes through out the experiment, or - the other direction - on increasing fatigue


```{r warning=FALSE}

dag <- dagitty('dag {
Big5 [adjusted,pos="-0.823,0.657"]

# Synthetic data

We will now create synth data that will copy the relations we assume in our DAG. Assigning concrete coefficients will also help us to test our model - we should find exactly those causalities that we had in mind when creating these data

```{r}

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(0209)

# Define participants, total unique concepts, and modalities
n_participants <- 120
n_total_concepts <- 21  # Total unique concepts
n_concepts_per_participant <- 21  # Each participant works with 21 concepts
n_modalities <- 3  # gesture, vocal, combined

# Generate participant IDs
participants <- 1:n_participants

# Simulate Big5 personality traits (standardized between 0 and 1) and Familiarity (between 0 and 1) for participants
Big5 <- runif(n_participants, min = 0, max = 1)  # Continuous values between 0 and 1
Familiarity <- runif(n_participants, min = 0, max = 1)  # Continuous values between 0 and 1

# Create a matrix to hold expressibility values for each concept in each modality
expressibility_matrix <- matrix(runif(n_total_concepts * n_modalities, min = 0, max = 1), nrow = n_total_concepts, ncol = n_modalities)

# Randomly sample 21 unique concepts for each participant
final_data <- data.frame()

# Define a function to assign CommAtt and Eff for a single participant
simulate_participant <- function(participant_id) {
  # Randomly sample 21 unique concepts from the total pool of 84
  selected_concepts <- sample(1:n_total_concepts, n_concepts_per_participant)
  
  participant_data <- data.frame()
  trial_number <- 1  # Initialize trial number
  
  for (concept_id in selected_concepts) {
    # Randomly determine the modality for the concept
    modality <- sample(c("gesture", "vocal", "combined"), 1)
    
    # Calculate expressibility based on modality
    expressibility_score <- ifelse(modality == "vocal", expressibility_matrix[concept_id, 1] * 0.6, 
                                    ifelse(modality == "gesture", expressibility_matrix[concept_id, 2], 
                                           expressibility_matrix[concept_id, 3] * 1.2))
    
    # Determine Communicative Attempts based solely on expressibility, familiarity, and Big5
    base_prob <- c(0.33, 0.33, 0.33)  # Equal chance for 1, 2, or 3 attempts
    
    # Modify probabilities based on familiarity, Big5, and expressibility
    adjusted_prob <- base_prob * c(1 - Familiarity[participant_id], # 3 times for each
                                    1 - Familiarity[participant_id],
                                    1 - Familiarity[participant_id]) * 
                     c(1 - Big5[participant_id],
                       1 - Big5[participant_id],
                       1 - Big5[participant_id]) * 
                     c(1 - expressibility_score,
                       1 - expressibility_score,
                       1 - expressibility_score)
    
    # Normalize the adjusted probabilities
    adjusted_prob <- adjusted_prob / sum(adjusted_prob)
    
    # Sample the number of communicative attempts based on adjusted probabilities
    n_attempts <- sample(1:3, 1, prob = adjusted_prob)
    
    # Loop through the number of attempts and increment CommAtt correctly
    for (attempt in 1:n_attempts) {
      # Calculate Eff for the first attempt
      if (attempt == 1) {
        Eff <- 1.15 * Big5[participant_id] + 
               1.10 * Familiarity[participant_id] + 
               1.20 * expressibility_score + 
               rnorm(1, mean = 1, sd = 0.5)
        
        # Adjust Eff based on modality
        if (modality == "combined") {
          
          Eff <- Eff * 0.7  # Slight moderation for combined modality
        }
      }
      
      # Adjust Eff for subsequent attempts
      if (attempt == 2) {
        Eff <- 1.15 * Big5[participant_id] + 
               1.10 * Familiarity[participant_id] + 
               1.20 * expressibility_score + 
               rnorm(1, mean = 1, sd = 0.5)
        Eff <- Eff * 1.50  # Multiply effort by 1.50 for the second attempt
      } else if (attempt == 3) {
        Eff <- 1.15 * Big5[participant_id] + 
               1.10 * Familiarity[participant_id] + 
               1.20 * expressibility_score + 
               rnorm(1, mean = 1, sd = 0.5)
        Eff <- Eff * 0.70  # Multiply effort by 0.70 for the third attempt
      }
      
      # Create row for each attempt
      participant_data <- rbind(participant_data, data.frame(
        Participant = participant_id,
        Concept = concept_id,
        Modality = modality,
        Big5 = Big5[participant_id],
        Familiarity = Familiarity[participant_id],
        Expressibility = expressibility_score,
        CommAtt = attempt,  # Correctly set the attempt number
        Eff = Eff,
        TrialNumber = trial_number  # Set trial number for this attempt
      ))
      
      # Increment the trial number after each attempt
      trial_number <- trial_number + 1
    }
  }
  
  return(participant_data)
}

# Simulate data for all participants
for (i in participants) {
  final_data <- rbind(final_data, simulate_participant(i))
}

# Preview the first few rows of the final data
head(final_data)

```

So now we have synthetic data where we exactly defined (using coefficients) what is the relationship between certain variables

1) CommAtt -> Eff

The effort for second attempt is multiplied by 1.25 (Beta = 1.25)
The effort for third attempts by 0.9 (ie decreases, Beta = 0.9)

2) Fam -> Eff & CommAtt

Beta = 1.10 for Eff
Negative effect on CommAtt


3) Big5 -> Eff & CommAtt

Beta = 1.15 for Eff
Negative effect on CommAtt

4) Expr -> Eff & CommAtt

Beta = 1.20 for Eff
Negative effect on CommAtt

5) TrNum -> Eff & CommAtt 

Beta = could be both neg (fatigue) or positive (learning)

## DP exploring

## Question: number of trials = number of concepts?

**Q: Is it by design that each participant had multiples of each concept?**

:::


# Simple linear mixed model

Before we do full Bayesian, we do quick LMM to see whether we are on good track

::: {.callout-note}
## Question: contrast coding?

**Q: Do we want to use contrast coding?**

:::

```{r}
# Convert necessary columns to factors
final_data$CommAtt <- as.factor(final_data$CommAtt)
final_data$Modality <- as.factor(final_data$Modality)
final_data$Participant <- as.factor(final_data$Participant)
final_data$Concept <- as.factor(final_data$Concept)
final_data$TrialNumber <- as.numeric(final_data$TrialNumber)  # Ensure TrialNumber is numeric
```

DP: Check contrasts of factors

```{r}
contrasts(final_data$CommAtt) <- MASS::contr.sdif(3)
contrasts(final_data$Modality) <- contr.sum(3)/2
```


Centre trial number

```{r}
final_data$TrialNumber_c <- final_data$TrialNumber - median(range(final_data$TrialNumber))
range(final_data$TrialNumber_c)
range(final_data$TrialNumber)
```

Standardize (z-score) all *continuous* predictors.

But if the measures of familiarity, expressibility, and big5 (but is expressibility continuous?) are on a rating scale we can just subtract the median again from these to centre them (and we don't need to standardize).

```{r}
final_data$Familiarity <- final_data$Familiarity - median(range(final_data$Familiarity))

final_data$Big5 <- final_data$Big5 - median(range(final_data$Big5))
```


Z-score expressibility

```{r}
final_data <-
  final_data |> 
  mutate(Expressibility_z = (Expressibility - mean(Expressibility))/ sd(final_data$Expressibility, na.rm = T))
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Fit the linear mixed-effects model
model <- lmer(Eff ~ CommAtt + Familiarity + Big5 + Expressibility + TrialNumber_c + Modality + (1 | Participant) + (1 | Concept), data = final_data)

# Summary of the model
summary(model)

# Check model diagnostics
# Plot residuals vs fitted values
plot(model)

# Extract coefficients
coefficients <- summary(model)$coefficients
print(coefficients)

# If you want to save the model output
saveRDS(model, here("06_Modeling", "models", "linear_mixed_effects_model.rds"))
```


```{r}
model <- readRDS(here("06_Modeling", "models", "linear_mixed_effects_model.rds"))
summary(model)

```

The Betas seem quite close to how we create the synthetic data, probably there are some other moderations since the causal relations between the variables are quite complex

::: {.callout-note}

## Open question: dyad + participant

**How/whether to include participant in addition to dyad in the random effects**

Our thoughts: participant could maybe be nested within dyad, or do we not need participant? Must be something suggested in the literature.

Participant probably must be included because the Big 5 personality trait measure corresponds to each participant within the dyad.

Check: https://github.com/FredericBlum/exploring-individual-variation-in-turkish-heritage-speakers-complex-linguistic-productions

Onur and Frede on nesting:

First, we do not use mono- versus bilingualism or even the group variable as a main independent variable in our model. Instead, it is incorporated in a nested random effect. This indicates that we do not view the speaker group status as a main driver of DM production. Second, the group variable that we utilize does not take one of the three speaker groups as a baseline. We sum-coded the variable which incorporates the idea that monolinguals cannot be an adequate baseline for bilinguals.

# Bayesian model

Potential ways:

- LMMs - but we assume there might be some non-linearity (e.g., effort will increase in 2nd attempt, but not third)
- b-splines - but our 'timeline' consists of only three points (attempts). We could try but maybe b-splines are unncessarilly complex
- ordinal regression

Eff ~ Normal(μ,σ^2)
μ= β0 + β1*CommAtt

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(bayesplot)
library(brms)
library(beepr)

# use all available cores for parallel computing
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())

```

Let's start slowly, first with simple model accounting only for outcome + main predictor

```{r model1 - simple, eval=FALSE}
fit_eff1 <- brm(Eff ~ 1 + CommAtt, data=final_data)
saveRDS(fit_eff1, here("06_Modeling", "models", "fit_eff1.rds"))

beep(5)

```


```{r model1 - simple summary}

fit_eff1 <- readRDS(here("06_Modeling", "models", "fit_eff1.rds"))

summary(fit_eff1)
# even so simple model can quite well capture the relationship in the simulated data

plot(conditional_effects(fit_eff1), points = TRUE)
# but there is quite a lot of variation, causing overlap

pp_check(fit_eff1, type = "dens_overlay")
# we see that the simulated data are not that loyal to the data

pp_check(fit_eff1, type = "error_scatter_avg")
# instead of cloud of points, we see almost perfectly linear relationship between outcome and residuals, indicating strong problems with the independence assumption of the errors.

```

Now we know we will probably need partial pooling for participants, because they share lot of commonalities
(Later we might adapt this, because it might be participant within dyads. Dyads might also share lot of commonalities)

```{r eval=FALSE}

fit_eff2 <- brm(Eff ~ 1 + CommAtt + (1 | Participant), data=final_data)
saveRDS(fit_eff2, here("06_Modeling", "models", "fit_eff2.rds"))

beep(5)
```


```{r}

fit_eff2 <- readRDS(here("06_Modeling", "models", "fit_eff2.rds"))

summary(fit_eff2)

plot(conditional_effects(fit_eff2), points = TRUE)
# stays the same

pp_check(fit_eff2, type = "dens_overlay")
# not really improvement

pp_check(fit_eff2, type = "error_scatter_avg")
# ok, here we see some improvement here!

# checking to coeff of the parameters
coef(fit_eff2)

```

Some more diagnostics
```{r}

vars <- c("b_Intercept", "r_Participant[1,Intercept]", "r_Participant[2,Intercept]")
pairs(fit_eff2, variable = vars)

```
 We see negative correlation between b0 and b0j (and b0j have weak positive correlation with one another)
 
```{r}

draws_eff2 <- as.matrix(fit_eff2, variable = vars)
colnames(draws_eff2) <- c("b0", "b0_1", "b0_2")
cors_eff2 <- cor(draws_eff2)
print(cors_eff2, digits = 2)

```

Correlation between the parameters

```{r}

coef_eff2 <- coef(fit_eff2, summary = FALSE)

print(cor(coef_eff2$Participant[, 1:5, "Intercept"]), digits = 2)

```

Per-subject predicitons into the plot
```{r}

conditions <- make_conditions(final_data, "Participant")
ce <- conditional_effects(
fit_eff2, conditions = conditions,
re_formula = NULL
)
plot(ce, ncol = 6, points = TRUE)

# ok this is too many pcns to see anything:)

```

Compare the first two models
```{r}

loo_eff1 <- loo(fit_eff1)
loo_eff2 <- loo(fit_eff2)

loo_compare(loo_eff1, loo_eff2)

```


Let's also add varying slope, because ComAtt will too vary across subjects

```{r eval=FALSE}
fit_eff3 <- brm(Eff ~ 1 + CommAtt + (1 + CommAtt | Participant), # note that there was a mistake before
                data=final_data,
                # Number of cores to use
                cores = 4,)
saveRDS(fit_eff3, here("06_Modeling", "models", "fit_eff3.rds"))

beep(5)
```


```{r}

fit_eff3 <- readRDS(here("06_Modeling", "models", "fit_eff3.rds"))

summary(fit_eff3)

plot(conditional_effects(fit_eff3), points = TRUE)
# now the condidence intervals are much wider

pp_check(fit_eff3, type = "dens_overlay")
# not really improvement

pp_check(fit_eff3, type = "error_scatter_avg")
# blobby, but still very correlated

```

Now let's finally replicate our DAG
```{r eval=FALSE}

fit_eff4 <- brm(Eff ~ 1 + CommAtt + Familiarity + Big5 + Expressibility_z + TrialNumber_c + Modality + (1 | Participant) + (1 | Concept),
                data = final_data,
                cores = 4)

saveRDS(fit_eff4, here("06_Modeling", "models", "fit_eff4.rds"))


beep(5)

```


```{r}

fit_eff4 <- readRDS(here("06_Modeling", "models", "fit_eff4.rds"))

# summary
summary(fit_eff4)
# the coefficients again look similar to what we set in the data (except perhaps expressibility?)

plot(fit_eff4)
plot(conditional_effects(fit_eff4), points = TRUE)
# the CrI are now again in sensible width

pp_check(fit_eff4, type = "dens_overlay")
# not really improvement

pp_check(fit_eff4, type = "error_scatter_avg")
# blobby, but still correlated

# note that we are still missing proper non-def priors

```

## Model with vayring intercepts

```{r eval=FALSE}

fit_eff5 <- brm(Eff ~ 1 + CommAtt + Modality + (1 | Participant) + (1 | Concept) + (1 | Familiarity) + (1 | Big5) + (1 | Expressibility_z) + (1 | TrialNumber_c), 
                data = final_data,
                cores = 4)

# NOTE: I accidentally rewrote fit5 with model fit6 so this will need to be re-run and re-saved

saveRDS(fit_eff5, here("06_Modeling", "models", "fit_eff5.rds"))

beep(5)

```


```{r}

fit_eff5 <- readRDS(here("06_Modeling", "models", "fit_eff5.rds"))

# summary
summary(fit_eff5)
# the coefficients again look similar to what we set in the data (except perhaps expressibility?)

plot(fit_eff5)
plot(conditional_effects(fit_eff5), points = TRUE)
# the CrI are now again in sensible width

pp_check(fit_eff5, type = "dens_overlay")
# not really improvement

pp_check(fit_eff5, type = "error_scatter_avg")
# blobby, but still correlated

```

## Model with varying slopes and intercepts

So we not only assume that different participants have different base level for effort. But also that they differently 'response' to the communicative attempt

Same for familiarity, Big5, expressibility
```{r eval=FALSE}

fit_eff6 <- brm(Eff ~ 1 + CommAtt + Modality + (1 + CommAtt | Participant) + (1 | Concept) + (1 + CommAtt | Familiarity) + (1 + CommAtt | Big5) + (1 + CommAtt | Expressibility_z) + (1 | TrialNumber_c), 
                data = final_data,
                cores = 4)

saveRDS(fit_eff6, here("06_Modeling", "models", "fit_eff6.rds"))
beep(5)
```


```{r}

fit_eff6 <- readRDS(here("06_Modeling", "models", "fit_eff6.rds"))

# summary
summary(fit_eff6)
# not that there are troubles with convergence! (default priors)

plot(fit_eff6)
plot(conditional_effects(fit_eff6), points = TRUE)
# looks ok

pp_check(fit_eff6, type = "dens_overlay")
# nice!!! this is definitely improvement

pp_check(fit_eff6, type = "error_scatter_avg")
# even this looks quite nice

```

# Priors

Let's get some intuition going and plot our prior expectations


Let's avoid flat priors so that we can help regularize the model. We can use some scientifically realistic ranges

## Eff

If CommAtt=1, Effort can be any positive number (depending on what is the feature)

```{r}

p1 <-
  tibble(x = seq(from = 0, to = 5, by = .1)) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = dnorm(x, mean = 2.5, sd = 1))) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 5, by = .5)) +
  labs(title = "mu ~ dnorm(2.5, 1)",
       y = "density")

p1

```

## Beta (CommAtt)

Beta can be go to either directions, but let's not expect they will go too crazy

```{r}

p2 <-
  tibble(x = seq(from = -5, to = 5, by = .1)) %>% 
  
  geom_line() +
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1.5))) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = .5)) +
  labs(title = "Beta ~ dnorm(0, 2)",
       y = "density")

p2

```

## sigma

sd are positives

sd of 10 is 100

```{r}

p3 <-
  tibble(x = seq(from = -1, to = 6, by = .1)) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = dunif(x, min = 0, max = 5))) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 5, by = .5)) +
  labs(title = "Beta ~ dunif(0, 5)",
       y = "density")

p3


```

## Familiarity



## Big5

## Expressibility

## TrialNum

## Modality




```{r}

#(p1 + xlab("mu") | p2 + xlab("sigma")) / (p3 | p4)

```
Now we will try to fit the same model but with our priors
```{r}

# check what priors need to be specified
get_prior(Eff ~ 1 + CommAtt + Modality + (1 + CommAtt | Participant) + (1 | Concept) + (1 + CommAtt | Familiarity) + (1 + CommAtt | Big5) + (1 + CommAtt | Expressibility_z) + (1 | TrialNumber_c),
                prior = priors_eff7,
                data = final_data)

Note that adding varying slope is maybe not necessary for all the current variables, namely Big5, Expressibility, TrialNumber and Familiarity.

We need to have them in the model to avoid confounds (see DAG), but let's take them one by one

1) Familiarity

As it's influencing CommAtt and Effort, it should be there as fixed effect to block the causal path.

We also expect different baselines of effort depending on how familiar two people are, so varying intercept is accurate for this

Do we expect that familiarity affects people differently? Perhaps not necessarily. However, for some people it might be that familiarity leads to bigger willingness to be more effortful, for some it means that they know each other so well that they don't need to put so much effort into things (they are more conventional in a sense)

There should also potentially be an interaction between Familiarity and CommAtt - high familiarity might produce high effort in first attempt, but in the following attempts there will be less needed

so

+ Familiarity
+ (1 + CommAtt | Familiarity)

2) Big5

As it's influencing CommAtt and Effort, it should be there as fixed effect to block the causal path.

We also expect different baselines of effort depending on how, for example, open people are, so that's why we go for varying intercept.

Do we expect that personality traits affect people differently? Probably not

so

+ Big5
+ (1 | Big5)

3) Expressibility

As it's influencing CommAtt and Effort, it should be there as fixed effect to block the causal path.

Do we expect different baselines of effort depending on how the concept is expressible? Yes, probably

Do we expect that expressibility could influence effort differently? Not sure

Let's do the same model, but familiarity will not have varying slope
```{r}

fit_eff9 <- brm(Eff ~ 1 + CommAtt + Modality + Big5 + Familiarity + Expressibility_z +  (1 + CommAtt | Participant) + (1 | Concept)  + (1 | Expressibility_z) + (1 | TrialNumber_c), 
                data = final_data,
                prior = priors_eff8,
                cores = 4)

```



Ok now I am making a bit better sense of it

so we definitely have our main predictor CommAtt

We have other predictors that we believe moderate the effect - that is modality, familiarity, expressibility, big5

we want to have also varying intercept and slope for some

- participants - because we believe that their baseline effort varies, and that the effect of commatt on eff might vary across them

- same for concepts

we want to have varying intercept for TrialNumber because there might be variation between earlier and later performances (either learning, or fatigue)

```{r}

# Define the priors using Student's t-distribution for fixed effects
priors_eff9 <- c(
  # Prior for the intercept
  set_prior("student_t(3, 2.5, 1)", class = "Intercept"),
  
  # Priors for the main effects using Student's t-distribution
  set_prior("student_t(3, 0, 2.5)", class = "b", coef = "CommAtt2M1"),
  set_prior("student_t(3, 0, 2.5)", class = "b", coef = "CommAtt3M2"),
  set_prior("student_t(3, 0, 1.5)", class = "b", coef = "Modality1"),
  set_prior("student_t(3, 0, 1.5)", class = "b", coef = "Modality2"),
  set_prior("student_t(3, 0, 1)", class = "b", coef = "Big5"),
  set_prior("student_t(3, 0, 1)", class = "b", coef = "Familiarity"),
  set_prior("student_t(3, 0, 2.5)", class = "b", coef = "Expressibility_z"),
  set_prior("normal(0, 0.5)", class = "sd", group = "TrialNumber_c"),   # Random effect for Trial Number (Intercept)

  # Varying effects for Participant (keeping as Cauchy)
  set_prior("cauchy(0, 1)", class = "sd", group = "Participant"),
  
  # Varying effects for Concept (keeping as Cauchy)
  set_prior("cauchy(0, 1)", class = "sd", group = "Concept"),
  
  # Priors for random effects standard deviations (Cauchy)

  # Prior for residual standard deviation (sigma)

                prior=priors_eff9,
                cores = 4)

summary(fit_eff9)

plot(fit_eff9)
# this looks okay but our correlation still looks somewhat weird, causing low Bulk ESS - we will need to boost te lkj prior
plot(conditional_effects(fit_eff9), points = TRUE)

# stays the same

## Where to next

What are potential interactions?

- Modality*Expressibility (only highly expressive concepts might give modality the power to affect effort)
- Big5*Modality (only in vocal modality traits could matter)
- Big5 and/or Familiarity * CommAtt
