1) CUMMULATIVE vs INSTANT
- first, correlated features in XGBoost?
- correlation in XGBoost?
- look at both - average dynamics vs. cummulative
- look at the explained variance in comparison 

CORRELATION OF THE VARIABLES IN XGBOOST
- we want to capture a different dimensions of the complex movement
- PCA for components -> Variable from XGBoost per each component (2-3 vars per PC)
- (or k-means, same idea but different mathematics)

option1: xgboost on separate PC?
option2: xgboost on all, but parallel PCA and pick accordingly

Check literature!!!
How do you deal with cross-correlation in XGBoost?

2) RELATIVE vs ABSOLUTE EFFORT

- relative better, but we need to take into consideration that people don't know themselves what is their maximum
- normalize on all data (part1, part2)

3) MOVEMENT THRESHOLD
- 60% for all, blessed by supervisors

4) CONCEPT-RELATED EFFORT
- extra question, but later
- but put into discussion
- and still look into inter-individual variation
